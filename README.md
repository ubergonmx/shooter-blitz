# Shooter Blitz

## Description

The project chosen is a simple top-view 3D shooter game where players will engage in combat against other players. The game environment is set in a desolate urban wasteland littered with debris, garbage, and broken cars. Massive shipping containers and barrels dot the landscape, providing cover and obstacles for players to navigate. Amidst the wreckage, makeshift shelters constructed from water tanks and small "container"-like houses offer temporary refuge. The goal of the game is to eliminate as many opposing players as possible.

The inspiration for this project stems from our childhood of playing countless hours of Boxhead as well as Minecraft. By using techniques we learned in class and also from online tutorials, we were able to model, animate, and program in 3JS, and we were able to create our vision of a 3D game similar to Boxhead but with a new environment and added Minecraft characters. Through this game, we were able to showcase what we learned by applying 3D graphics and animation in a shooter game genre.
